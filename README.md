## Introduction
Simple Bookmark is a self-hosted bookmark management platform designed to provide users with an intuitive and efficient way to organize and access their web page collections.

## The problem

In today's information-rich internet environment, users often face the challenge of effectively managing and quickly accessing a large number of bookmarks. Existing bookmark management services often rely on third-party platforms, which not only involve privacy and security concerns but also pose risks in terms of service availability and data control.

## The solution

Simple Bookmark offers a self-hosted solution where users can deploy the application on their own server, giving them full control over their data. Additionally, by utilizing modern front-end and back-end technologies, Simple Bookmark ensures the performance and scalability of the application.

## Stack

- Front-end: Built with React and Redux for a responsive user interface and efficient state management.
- Testing: Jest for unit and snapshot testing to maintain code quality.
- Server-Side Rendering: Next.js is used for server-side rendering, providing faster page load times and improved SEO.
- Back-end: Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, handles backend logic and API requests.
